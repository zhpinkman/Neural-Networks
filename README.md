# Neural-Networks
The aim of this repository is to include all the projects I have done that fall under Neural Networks. 
Some of these projects were done because of self interest, and others were part of the graduate course titled Neural Networks that was offered at the University of Tehran under the supervision of [Prof. Kalhor](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~akalhor).
There are different kinds of projects included in this repository, such as simple neural networks, recurrent neural networks, etc.
